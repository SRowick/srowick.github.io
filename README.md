# Portfolio Website & Game Showcase

This is a professional portfolio site designed to showcase my games and demonstrate front-end development skills. It features clean structure, maintainability, responsive UI and modern web development practices.

## Tech Stack

- React, Typescript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite.
- Libraries: MUI, Framer Motion, Yet Another React Lightbox

## Future Improvements

- A title bar for the GamePage pages, so that the user doesn't have to hit the browser's back button or scroll to the bottom of the page to return to home.
- Use MUI skeleton components to display a placeholder preview of my content before the data gets loaded to reduce load-time frustration/jankiness.
- Presskit page with pre-packaged promotional materials and graphics for media / content creators.
