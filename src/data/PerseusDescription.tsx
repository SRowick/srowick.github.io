          Growing up on a quiet island adrift in the Aegean, you thought life
          would be simple. You were wrong.

          You assumed you would follow the humble fisherman's trade... but now a
          demand has been made of you: Bring back the head of Medusa, the
          monster whose gaze can turn men to stone. Your mother Danae knew this
          day would come. She tells you the truth at last - your father is Zeus,
          king of the gods. And there is more: The oracle of Delphi said you are
          destined to kill your grandfather, the king of Argos.

          A fish-boy from the islands and a prince born of Zeus, your two lives
          couldn't have less in common. And now you're being thrust into the
          strange new world of the mainland to find the lair of Medusa. The gods
          watch you. The king fears you. And they say no man can escape his
          fate...

        <b>A FAITHFUL ADAPTION</b>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The tale of <b>Perseus</b>, slayer of Medusa and savior of Andromeda, is
        one of the most beloved stories in Greek mythology. Many poets
        celebrated it, and it was a great favourite in Ancient Greece.
      </p>
      <p>
        We here at <b>Absent Dragon</b> present an RPG about Perseus that stays
        true to the original myth, drawing upon the works of Apollodorus,
        Hesiod, Pindar and other classical texts. The game has been meticulously
        researched to ensure itâ€™s as faithful as possible not only to the tale
        of Perseus, but to Greek mythology as a whole.
